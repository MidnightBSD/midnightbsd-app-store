<h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide
    this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you
    can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this
    notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point
    where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>

<h3>The Information We Collect:</h3>

<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the MidnightBSD App Store
    website. On some pages, you can search for software or rate software. The types
    of personal information collected at these pages are:</p>

<p>IP Address<br>
   Web Browser<br>
    Search Terms<br>
    Rating (if any)</p>

<h3>The Way We Use Information:</h3>

<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses
    are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>

<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website
    and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that

    X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but
    we would
    not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. Currently,
    we do not use advertising on our site for third parties. We may change this
    policy in the future.</p>

<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided
    to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also
    providing
    you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
    (we do not sell your e-mail addresses! Spam is a serious problem, and software
    is installed on our mail servers to prevent it.)</p>

<h3>Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct
    use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
    and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect
    online. In the future we plan on adding SSL technology to this site and use
    of encryption technologies to protect sensitive information. </p>

<h3>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h3>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that
    reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those
    we actually know are under 13.</p>

<h3>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h3>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps
    to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>

<h3>How To Contact Us</h3>

<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies,
    please send us an email at <a href="mailto:webmaster@midnightbsd.org">webmaster@midnightbsd.org</a>.</p>
